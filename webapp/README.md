# Spotify Million Playlist Analysis Web Application

## Overview
This web application provides an interface for analyzing the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset using machine learning models. It visualizes playlist popularity predictions and artist clustering results.

## Features
1. **Playlist Popularity Analysis**
   - Predicts playlist popularity using Random Forest
   - Shows feature importance visualization
   - Displays RMSE and RÂ² metrics

2. **Artist Trend Analysis**
   - Clusters artists based on popularity patterns
   - Provides statistical summaries
   - Shows cluster visualization

## Setup and Running

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Database Configuration
Update database credentials in `config.py`:
```python
DB_PARAMS = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'database': 'spotify_playlist_db',
    'user': 'your_username',
    'password': 'your_password',
    'port': '5432'
}
```

### Running the Application
1. Navigate to webapp directory:
```bash
cd webapp
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
# Create virtual environment
